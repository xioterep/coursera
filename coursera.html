        <p>  Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of the Uchiha Clan. 
         He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju, 
         with the intention of bringing about an era of peace. When the two couldn't agree on 
         how to achieve that peace, they fought for control of the village, a conflict which 
         ended in Madara's death. Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to
         work on his own plans. Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his 
         knowledge and plans to Obito shortly before his actual death. Years later, Madara would
         be revived, only to see his plans foiled and ultimately, and finally, realising the
         error of his ways and making amends with Hashirama before his final death.</p></il>

    <div class="text1">
        <p> The Senju, the Uchiha, and all their affiliated clans came together to found a village
         of peace, where children would never need to die in battle. Madara and Hashirama,
         rekindling their childhood friendship, and Madara called that village Konohagakure,
         seeing it through leaves. But Madara's idea of peace differed from Hashirama's: where
         Hashirama envisioned cooperation with the other newly-formed villages, Madara desired 
         control so the peace could never be lost, evidenced by his attacking Iwagakure's Mū 
         and Ōnoki so that they would submit to Konoha's authority. When Hashirama was elected
         as Hokage, Konoha's leader, Madara also became concerned for the Uchiha's future, 
         believing this to be but the first step in the Senju's dominance. <br></p>

        <p>The Stone Tablet Zetsu altered had been in the Uchiha's possession for generations and
         was brought with them when they settled in Konoha. Through careful study, Madara was
         able to decipher enough of it to learn of the history of shinobi: of the endless
         cycle of failed peace and the destiny of battle between Uchiha and Senju, but also a
         means of unity for the world. With this knowledge, Madara decided Konoha was a failed
         experiment. He tried to convince his own clan and even Hashirama of the same 
         conclusion, but none would hear him. Madara chose to abandon the village, attacking 
         Konoha on multiple occasions, later returning with the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox under 
         his control to challenge Hashirama. They fought to exhaustion, and from the carnage
         of their battle the Valley of the End was formed. In the end, Madara was killed by
         Hashirama.<br></p>

    <il><h3 id="personality">1.2. Personality:</h3>
    <div class="text0">
        <img src="madara00.jpg" alt="Madara Uchiha sitting in his famous position looking down on the shinobi alliance." width="200" height="220">
    <div class="text1">
        <p> Madara's childhood was a product of the times he lived in: the constant fighting made
         him a perfectionist that would keep at something until he mastered it, and his
         triumphs on the battlefield made him very confident in his abilities and talent. 
         Whenever one of these personality traits was challenged, as they tended to be by 
         Hashirama, Madara's competitive streak would emerge. Madara did not mind Hashirama's
         influence in this regard; he believed that the only way to survive in the shinobi
         world was to make allies with one's enemies. His exposure to Hashirama is credited
         for Madara not experiencing the Uchiha's "Curse of Hatred" or at the very least, not
         being victimised by it as much as Izuna was and even though he claimed to have
         abandoned his friendship with Hashirama, Madara still held onto their friendship
         subconsciously. Madara's actions and beliefs were singularly focused on protecting
         Izuna, his only surviving brother. So long as he had Izuna, Madara was reasonable
         and kind, willing to make concessions for a perceived greater good.<br></p>

        <p> Madara changed after Izuna's death, becoming bitter towards the Senju, particularly
         Hashirama since he still had a brother. Embracing his clan's Curse of Hatred, he
         opted to die for revenge rather than compromise or forgive. Although he was briefly
         convinced to set aside his grief and try to replace Izuna with the collective family
         of Konoha, he could never shake the feeling that he was betraying Izuna's memory.
         The increasing isolation of himself and other Uchiha from village politics ultimately
         convinced him of this, causing him to fully break with any other attachments.<br></p>

    <div class="text1">
        <p> Madara was a fair-skinned man with spiky, black hair that had a slight blue tint to it.
         In his childhood, his hair was chin-length that parted to frame the sides of his face.
         His casual attire consisted of a blue long sleeve shirt and white pants. While on the
         battlefield he wore the standard Uchiha outfit: a black shirt with a high-collar left
         slightly open and the clan's crest on its back, with blue pants and bandages around
         his shins. Around his waist he had a white sash that held a sack, presumably containing
         his ninja tools. Later, his sash was replaced by a belt, adorned with pouches and various
         weapons. He also wore another sash strapped across his shoulders which he used to hold his
         swords.<br></p>

        <p> As an adult, Madara had let his hair grow to waist-length with shoulder-length bangs
         framing the sides of his face, covering most of his right eye. He has several scars
         throughout his body. Although still relatively young, more prominent creases had
         developed under each of his eyes. At times, he wore crimson armour with numerous
         metal plates, forming protective guards along his chest, waist, shoulders and thighs.
         Most of the time, however, he continued wearing the same basic Uchiha outfit: a blue
         high-collared, long sleeve mantle that splits down the lower half and a simple,
         light-brown obi and a belt. During battle, he often carried an orange-brown gunbai
         which had a long black chain running up it. At one point, he wore a Konohagakure
         forehead protector. The anime also shows him wearing a metal belt, as well as a brown
         leather sash to hold some of his other weapons, and a pair of belt sashes to hold two
         of his swords.<br></p>

        Madara was one of the most powerful shinobi in history, recognised as the strongest 
         Uchiha in his lifetime and for decades after his death. A child prodigy, he killed
         several adult Senju before he had awakened his Sharingan. History remembers him as
         the only one able to compete with Hashirama Senju, a "God of Shinobi", and pushed
         him to his absolute limits. When Obito operated under Madara's name, fear of 
         Madara's power forced the Five Great Shinobi Countries, and the neutral Land of
         Iron, to band together and trigger the Fourth Shinobi World War, as it was noted
         Madara's name itself was power. After his return from death and various enhancements,
         Madara was able to decisively defeat thousands of shinobi, the Five Kage, and the
         nine tailed beasts, all at once respectively. Madara was also confident if he had
         senjutsu chakra, he would have been able to defeat Obito while the latter was the
         Ten-Tails' jinchūriki.<br></p>

        <p> Tobi, acting under Madara's name, moves into the final stages of the Eye of the Moon
         Plan by initiating a Fourth Shinobi World War. Before the war's start, Kabuto Yakushi
         approaches Tobi to try and form an alliance. When Tobi asks what will happen if he
         refuses, Kabuto resurrects Madara to show he knows that Tobi is not the true Madara
         and forces him to accept. Tobi reluctantly agrees and Kabuto de-summons Madara.<br></p>

        <p> Though he's frustrated by this setback, Hashirama is no longer preoccupied, so Madara
         forces him into a fight for two reasons: his simple desire to fight his rival once
         again and he also plans to oppose Obito and take his place as the caster of the Infinite
         Tsukuyomi. To accomplish the latter however, Madara needs senjutsu chakra, which Hashirama
         has. As their battle rages, Hashirama tries to convince Madara to postpone, but Madara
         repeatedly refuses. Nevertheless, he keeps track of Obito's progress and growing control
         of the Ten-Tails' power. After Obito's defeat, Madara is restrained by Hashirama's wood
         dragons and the Alliance moves in to seal him.<br></p>
